Build a Futuristic Admin Dashboard

Overview:
We need a cutting-edge “futuristic” admin console for our APSCSCL Trip Bookings project. It must be a full React+Vite boilerplate—functional components, reusable UI, crisp animations, and Google-Maps integration—matching the style of the two attached mockups.

Tech Stack:

React (hooks, functional) + Vite

Tailwind CSS + custom MUI theme (+ @mui/icons)

React Router (or your state/routing of choice)

Google Maps JavaScript API (geocoding + map + geo-fencing)

Key Requirements:

Login Page

Email + strong-password validation

Preloaded “Test User” credentials

Minimal, centered form with subtle animation

Global Layout

Header:

Left: hamburger → toggles sidebar (morphs between Mockup 1 and 2)

Center: search input

Right: notifications bell + avatar dropdown

Sidebar:

“Master” section → items: Good Seeds, Buffer Gowdan, MLS Points

Collapsible with icons + text, matching mockup styles

Good Seeds CRUD Page (/master/good-seeds)

“Add Good Seed” Modal/Panel with fields:

District (text/select)

Transport Type (select)

Good Name (text)

Route Address (autocomplete via Google Places)

On address selection → auto-fill street, city, state, latitude, longitude, pincode, and draw geo-fencing polygon on map

Map Preview: live Google Map showing marker + fenced area

Actions:

Reset → clears form & map

Submit → logs JSON payload in console and POSTs to /api/good-seeds

Component Library & Theming

/src/components/ folder of fully typed, theme-aware UI: Button, Input, Modal, Card, MapWrapper, etc.

Global Tailwind + MUI theme config for colors, shadows, transitions

Project Scaffold & Documentation

Complete folder structure with sample files:

css
Copy
Edit
src/
  api/
  components/
  pages/
  routes/
  styles/
README.md with npm install + npm run dev instructions

Embed 2–3 screenshots (or Vite preview link) showing login, sidebar toggled, and Good Seeds form/map

Style Notes:

Sleek, dark/light dual theme option

Soft neon glows, glass-morphism panels, smooth hover/focus animations

Responsive: desktop + tablet breakpoints
